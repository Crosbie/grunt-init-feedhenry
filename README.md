# grunt-init-feedhenry

> Create an app project for development within the
> [FeedHenry](http://www.feedhenry.com/) studio.

## Installation
Firstly, you should have [grunt-init](http://gruntjs.com/project-scaffolding)
installed globally.

Once that's done, place this template in your `~/.grunt-init/` folder on Linux &
Mac or `%USERPROFILE%\.grunt-init\` on Windows. You can do this simply using
git:

```
git clone git@github.com:garmur/grunt-init-feedhenry.git ~/.grunt-init/feedhenry
```

_Don't forget to change that to the correct directory if you're on Windows!_

## Usage
At the command-line, from _within_ your new project directory, run this command
and follow the instructions:

```
grunt-init feedhenry
```
